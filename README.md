In this project, I applied classification algorithms to interpret and categorize equipment data, specifically focusing on identifying failure types or indicating whether a failure occurred. I developed a model capable of accurately classifying the type of failure in a specific process or determining if a failure occurred. This approach aids in post-analysis and decision-making, allowing for a better understanding of equipment performance and maintenance needs.
The application of machine learning techniques in this project demonstrates my practical experience in data analysis and classification modeling. While the model doesnâ€™t predict or preemptively anticipate failures, it effectively interprets data patterns to categorize equipment performance outcomes. This experience showcases my ability to apply data science methodologies to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, contributing to proactive maintenance strategies and operational efficiency improvements.
